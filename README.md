# HantekDSO

This is quick and dirty port to Qt5. Especially dirty part is UI: I've convertd it with uic3.
This port was intended to be used on mac os, but feel free to port it to other platforms.
License is inherited from original HantekDSO project.

# Building

First of all you need to install dependencies: libusb and libusb-compat. On mac os I'm using brew.

Then complete build with qmake.
